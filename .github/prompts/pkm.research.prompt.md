Research the topic described below using `brave_web_search`. For each useful result, optionally use `#fetch` to get full content.

Then create a `resource` note in `30-Resources/` with:
- Full frontmatter (type: resource, status: active, tags, created, modified, related)
- A clear summary of what you found
- Key points as bullet list
- Source URLs at the bottom
- Wiki-links to any related existing notes in the vault

Before creating, search the vault with `search_notes` to check if the topic is already covered. If so, update the existing note instead.
